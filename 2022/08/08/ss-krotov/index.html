<p>The revised edition of ’Aptitude Test Problems in Physics’ is one of the finest books trusted by lecturers and students since it was published first. Divided in 4 chapters, the book is a collection of problems from the Moscow Physics Olympiad. It is a best supplementary text that helps its readers to develop an intuitive approach to physics. Explanatory Hints and Solutions have been given to All the Questions at the end of these books. This book contains large number of problems for the purpose of thorough practice of the various concepts covered. It also helps in enhancing the practical knowledge with inbuilt practice sets and detailed and authentic solutions.

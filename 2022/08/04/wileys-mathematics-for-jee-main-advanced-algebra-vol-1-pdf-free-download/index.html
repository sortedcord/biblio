<meta name="description" content="Algebra is frequently called the gatekeeper subject. It lays the foundation for higher Mathematics and is of utmost importance to engineering students. This book has been written by a pioneer teacher associated with IIT-JEE coaching, D.N. Murti, along with Dr. U.M. Swamy who had an illustrious career as a renowned mathematician. The book has a two-fold advantage: (a) conceptual strength provided by accurate, precise but sufficient coverage of topics; (B) solved and unsolved problems as per IIT-JEE pattern for strengthening concepts. The main idea is to make students understand the theory behind to enable them to strategize a given problem and tactically solve it." />

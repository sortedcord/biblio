IEO or the International English Olympiad is a yearly exam conducted by the Science Olympiad Foundation (SOF) for school students. It is an English language and grammar competition that helps students judge themselves in terms of their English knowledge. Participating students compete at different levels including school, city, zonal and international level. SOF, which also organises a number of other such Olympiads like the NSO, NCO, IMO, ICSO and IGKO, tests students on the basis of their English language and grammar knowledge. The marks obtained in the Olympiad help students judge themselves by comparing it with other students from all across the country as well as abroad. Students participating in IEO also receive a Student Performance Report (SPR) that provides them a detailed analysis of their performance.

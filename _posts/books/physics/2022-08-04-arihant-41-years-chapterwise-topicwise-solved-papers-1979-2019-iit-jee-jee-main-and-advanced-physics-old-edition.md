## Key Features of this Book:

- This Book contains Chapterwise &amp; Topicwise Problems and solutions from 41 years JEE Advanced papers (1979-2019)
- Questions in every chapter are categorized into Sub Topics
- It also Includes Problems and solutions for last 7 years JEE Main Papers (2013-2019)
- The best part of this books is Proper subjective solutions are given for each question

## **Drawback of this Book:**

- Summary of every chapter like (weightage and analysis) is not given in this book which becomes the biggest negative of this 2019 Edition of Arihant JEE Solved Papers. Hoping this could be updated in upcoming edition (2020).

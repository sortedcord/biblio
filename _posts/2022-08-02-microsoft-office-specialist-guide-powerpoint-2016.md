Download MOS 2016 Study Guide for Microsoft PowerPoint pdf for free.

MOS 2016 Study Guide for Microsoft PowerPoint is designed for experienced computer users seeking Microsoft Office Specialist certification in PowerPoint 2016. MOS exams for individual programs are practical rather than theoretical. You must demonstrate that you can complete certain tasks or projects rather than simply answer questions about program features.

 The successful MOS certification candidate will have at least six months of experience using all aspects of the application on a regular basis; for example, using PowerPoint at work or school to create and manage presentations and slides, insert and format slide content (including shapes, text, tables, charts, SmartArt graphics, images, and media), animate slide content, transition between slides, manage multiple versions of a presentation, and prepare presentations for delivery.

As a certification candidate, you probably have a lot of experience with the program you want to become certified in. Many of the procedures described in this book will be familiar to you; others might not be. Read through each study section and ensure that you are familiar with the procedures, concepts, and tools discussed. In some cases, images depict the tools you will use to perform procedures related to the skill set. Study the images and ensure that you are familiar with the options available for each tool.

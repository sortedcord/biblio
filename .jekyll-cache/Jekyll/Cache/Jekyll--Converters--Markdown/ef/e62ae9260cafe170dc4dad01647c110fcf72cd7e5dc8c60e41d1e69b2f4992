I"÷<p>The first edition of this book was designed as a concise collection of important organic named reactions, rearrangements and reagents, along with their mechanisms and synthetic applications. The response to the book was quite satisfactory and SN Sanyal received numerous suggestions from teachers all over India. A common suggestion was to increase the scope of the original book by adding a chapter on the mechanisms of organic reactions. This has been done in this edition. Apart from this a few reactions and rearrangements have been added in the second chapter.</p>
